# Spring Boot CRUD API Application Project

-   **Why are we doing this?**

    The purpose of this task is to develop and assess our abilities in using an
    Agile environment for Project Management using Git and Jira, utilising
    databases and back-end development using SQL and Java, API development using
    Spring Boot and automated testing using Junit and Mockito.

-   **How I expected the challenge to go.**

    Before commencing work on this project, I expected to find issues with Git
    and testing, I find that without regular use these things become very
    difficult to absorb. I am comfortable with Java and Spring for the most part
    but am new to some of these concepts.

-   **What went well? / What didn't go as planned?**

    As suspected, I ran into several problems involving git whereby the
    occasional forgetfulness involving pulling down to local before push a
    commit landed me in severe hot water with many wasted man hours finding the
    solution. In hindsight this could have been added to my risk assessment and
    shall be for future projects. I have however learned from these mistakes and
    developed further skills

-   **Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.**

    Integration with a front-end web app in a real world environment possibly
    html based, utilising many more custom queries and expanding on the Lombok
    aspect of that to create those queries.

-   **Screenshots showing your postman requests and the output from the API.**

    The following screenshot show the interaction with the API using Postman.

**Stretch goals.**

As part of the allocated stretch goals I was able to implement custom
exceptions, Lombok and custom queries with the addition of and ERD diagram and
Class diagram that can be seen below. ![Graphical user interface, application,
